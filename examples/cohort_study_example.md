# Example: Cohort Study - Framingham Heart Study

## Background
The Framingham Heart Study is one of the most famous and influential cohort studies in medical history. It began in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts, with the goal of identifying risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

## Study Design
- **Type**: Prospective cohort study
- **Original cohort**: 5,209 residents of Framingham aged 30-62
- **Follow-up**: Ongoing, now in third generation
- **Data collection**: Biennial examinations, medical records, death certificates

## Key Findings
1. **Cigarette smoking** increases risk of coronary heart disease
2. **High blood pressure** is a major risk factor for heart disease
3. **High cholesterol** contributes to atherosclerosis
4. **Physical inactivity** increases cardiovascular risk
5. **Obesity** is associated with multiple risk factors

## Measures of Association
- **Relative Risk** for various exposures calculated
- **Attributable risk** estimated for preventable causes
- **Population attributable risk** for public health impact

## Impact
- Changed clinical practice worldwide
- Identified major modifiable risk factors
- Led to development of prevention strategies
- Influenced guidelines for hypertension, cholesterol management

## Strengths
- Large, well-characterized cohort
- Long-term follow-up
- Objective measurements
- Multiple generations studied

## Limitations
- Predominantly white population
- Volunteer bias possible
- Changes in medical practice over time
- Loss to follow-up

## Lessons Learned
- Cohort studies can identify risk factors
- Long-term investment yields valuable data
- Community-based studies enhance generalizability
- Ongoing data collection allows for new research questions

# Example: Case-Control Study - Oral Contraceptives and Venous Thromboembolism

## Background
In the 1960s, oral contraceptives became widely available. Case reports suggested a link with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Case-control studies were conducted to investigate this association.

## Study Design
- **Type**: Hospital-based case-control study
- **Cases**: Women aged 16-40 hospitalized with idiopathic VTE
- **Controls**: Women hospitalized for other conditions
- **Sample size**: ~100 cases, ~200 controls
- **Exposure**: Current use of oral contraceptives

## Key Results
- **Odds Ratio**: 4.0 (95% CI: 2.0-8.0)
- **Interpretation**: Women using oral contraceptives had 4 times higher risk of VTE
- **Dose-response**: Higher estrogen dose associated with higher risk

## Impact
- Led to reformulation of oral contraceptives
- Lower estrogen doses developed
- Informed risk-benefit assessment
- Changed clinical practice

## Methodological Considerations
- **Recall bias**: Potential issue, but exposure was current use
- **Confounding**: Controlled for age, smoking, obesity
- **Selection bias**: Hospital controls appropriate for acute condition

## Modern Context
- Risk with current low-dose contraceptives is much lower
- Absolute risk remains small
- Individual risk assessment important

# Example: Cross-Sectional Study - National Health Survey

## Background
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is conducted annually in the United States to assess health and nutritional status.

## Study Design
- **Type**: Cross-sectional survey
- **Population**: Representative sample of US civilians
- **Sample size**: ~5,000 participants annually
- **Data collection**: Interviews, physical examinations, laboratory tests

## Key Findings
- **Prevalence estimates**: Diabetes, obesity, hypertension
- **Risk factor distributions**: Smoking, diet, physical activity
- **Biomarker levels**: Cholesterol, glucose, vitamin D
- **Trends over time**: Changes in health indicators

## Measures
- **Prevalence ratios** for comparisons
- **Means and proportions** with confidence intervals
- **Age-standardized rates** for comparisons

## Applications
- Public health planning
- Policy development
- Research hypothesis generation
- Monitoring health trends

## Strengths
- Representative sample
- Objective measurements
- Comprehensive data
- National estimates

## Limitations
- Cannot establish causality
- Snapshot in time
- Potential non-response bias
- Cross-sectional fallacy

# Example: Randomized Controlled Trial - Women's Health Initiative

## Background
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was designed to test strategies for preventing heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

## Study Design
- **Type**: Randomized controlled trial
- **Participants**: 161,808 postmenopausal women aged 50-79
- **Interventions**:
  - Hormone therapy vs. placebo
  - Dietary modification vs. usual diet
  - Calcium/vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo
- **Follow-up**: 8-12 years

## Key Results
- **Hormone therapy**: Increased risk of heart disease, stroke, breast cancer
- **Dietary intervention**: Modest weight loss, reduced breast cancer risk
- **Calcium/vitamin D**: Reduced hip fracture risk

## Impact
- Changed practice of hormone replacement therapy
- Influenced dietary guidelines
- Improved understanding of postmenopausal health
- Led to re-evaluation of preventive strategies

## Methodological Features
- **Randomization**: Computer-generated, stratified by age and center
- **Blinding**: Double-blind for medication trials
- **Sample size**: Large enough to detect small effects
- **Adherence monitoring**: Regular assessments

## Challenges
- **Adverse findings**: Unexpected increased risks
- **Complex interventions**: Multiple components
- **Long-term follow-up**: Maintaining participation
- **Multiple outcomes**: Balancing benefits and harms

## Lessons
- Large trials can detect small but important effects
- Unexpected findings require careful interpretation
- Complex interventions need careful design
- Ethical considerations in preventive trials
