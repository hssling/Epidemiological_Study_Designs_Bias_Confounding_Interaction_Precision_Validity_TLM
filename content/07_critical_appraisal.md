# Module 7: Critical Appraisal of Study Designs

## Learning Objectives
- Apply critical appraisal frameworks to epidemiological studies
- Evaluate the validity and reliability of study findings
- Identify strengths and limitations of different study designs
- Make informed decisions about study quality and applicability

## Introduction to Critical Appraisal

**Critical appraisal** is the systematic evaluation of research evidence to assess its validity, reliability, and applicability to clinical practice or policy.

### Why Critical Appraisal Matters
- **Evidence-based practice**: Base decisions on best available evidence
- **Research quality**: Identify high-quality vs. low-quality studies
- **Bias identification**: Recognize potential threats to validity
- **Clinical relevance**: Determine applicability to specific contexts

## Frameworks for Critical Appraisal

### 1. CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme)
- **CASP checklists**: Structured questions for different study types
- **Domains**: Validity, reliability, applicability
- **Scoring**: Clear criteria for evaluation

### 2. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
- **Quality assessment**: High, moderate, low, very low quality
- **Factors considered**: Study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias
- **Strength of recommendations**: Strong vs. weak recommendations

### 3. STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology)
- **Checklist**: 22 items for reporting observational studies
- **Domains**: Title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion
- **Purpose**: Improve transparency and completeness of reporting

## Critical Appraisal of Observational Studies

### Cohort Studies

#### Key Questions to Ask:
1. **Study population**: Clearly defined? Representative?
2. **Exposure assessment**: Valid and reliable measurement?
3. **Outcome assessment**: Objective criteria? Blinded assessment?
4. **Follow-up**: Complete? Differential loss to follow-up?
5. **Confounding**: Important confounders measured and controlled?
6. **Analysis**: Appropriate statistical methods?

#### Common Pitfalls:
- **Immortal time bias**: Misclassification of follow-up time
- **Time-varying confounding**: Confounders change over time
- **Competing risks**: Other outcomes affect results

#### Example Appraisal:
**Study**: Coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes

**Strengths**: Large prospective cohort, objective outcome assessment
**Limitations**: Self-reported coffee consumption, residual confounding

### Case-Control Studies

#### Key Questions:
1. **Case definition**: Clear, consistent criteria?
2. **Control selection**: Appropriate source population?
3. **Exposure assessment**: Recall bias minimized?
4. **Matching**: Appropriate variables matched?
5. **Response rates**: High participation?
6. **Analysis**: Conditional vs. unconditional logistic regression?

#### Common Issues:
- **Recall bias**: Cases remember exposures better
- **Selection bias**: Controls not representative
- **Confounding by indication**: Disease severity affects exposure

#### Example Appraisal:
**Study**: Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism

**Strengths**: Population-based, validated outcomes
**Limitations**: Potential recall bias, confounding by smoking

### Cross-Sectional Studies

#### Key Questions:
1. **Sampling**: Random? Representative?
2. **Measurement timing**: Exposure and outcome measured simultaneously?
3. **Response rates**: High participation?
4. **Analysis**: Appropriate for cross-sectional design?

#### Limitations:
- **Temporality**: Cannot determine cause-effect
- **Prevalence-incidence bias**: Mix of prevalent and incident cases
- **Survival bias**: Only survivors included

## Critical Appraisal of Experimental Studies

### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

#### Key Questions:
1. **Randomization**: Adequate method? Concealed allocation?
2. **Blinding**: Participants, investigators, assessors blinded?
3. **Groups comparable**: Baseline characteristics similar?
4. **Intervention**: Clearly described? Compliance monitored?
5. **Outcome assessment**: Objective? Blinded?
6. **Analysis**: Intention-to-treat? Handling of missing data?
7. **Follow-up**: Complete? Differential loss?

#### Quality Assessment (Jadad Scale):
- **Randomization**: Adequate method (+1), inadequate (-1)
- **Blinding**: Adequate method (+1), inadequate (-1)
- **Withdrawals**: Described (+1)
- **Maximum score**: 5 points

#### Common Biases:
- **Performance bias**: Different care between groups
- **Attrition bias**: Differential dropouts
- **Reporting bias**: Selective outcome reporting

### Non-Randomized Trials

#### Additional Questions:
1. **Assignment method**: How were groups formed?
2. **Baseline differences**: Statistical adjustment performed?
3. **Confounding**: Important confounders controlled?

#### Limitations:
- **Selection bias**: Groups not comparable
- **Confounding**: Unmeasured confounders
- **Lower evidence quality**: GRADE approach

## Assessing Risk of Bias

### Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (for RCTs)
1. **Selection bias**: Random sequence generation, allocation concealment
2. **Performance bias**: Blinding of participants and personnel
3. **Detection bias**: Blinding of outcome assessment
4. **Attrition bias**: Incomplete outcome data
5. **Reporting bias**: Selective reporting
6. **Other bias**: Other sources of bias

### ROBINS-I Tool (for Non-Randomized Studies)
- **Domains**: Confounding, selection, classification, deviation, missing data, measurement, reporting
- **Overall risk**: Low, moderate, serious, critical, no information

## Evaluating Precision and Validity

### Precision
- **Confidence intervals**: Narrow vs. wide
- **P-values**: Statistical significance vs. clinical importance
- **Sample size**: Adequate power?
- **Standard errors**: Measurement precision

### Internal Validity
- **Bias control**: How well were biases minimized?
- **Confounding**: Appropriately controlled?
- **Measurement error**: Reliable and valid measures?

### External Validity (Generalizability)
- **Study population**: Similar to target population?
- **Setting**: Clinic vs. community vs. hospital?
- **Time period**: Current applicability?
- **Intervention delivery**: Feasible in practice?

## Quantitative Synthesis

### Meta-Analysis
- **Heterogeneity**: IÂ² statistic, Cochran's Q test
- **Publication bias**: Funnel plots, Egger's test
- **Subgroup analysis**: Sources of heterogeneity
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Robustness of findings

### GRADE Approach
- **Starting quality**: Based on study design
- **Quality modifiers**: Risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias
- **Final quality**: High, moderate, low, very low
