**Limitations**:
- Only uses extreme values
- Affected by outliers
- No information about data distribution

### Variance
**Population Variance**: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$

**Sample Variance**: $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

**Interpretation**: Average squared deviation from mean

### Standard Deviation
**Formula**: $s = \sqrt{s^2}$

**Example**: Data: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
Mean = 14, Variance = 8, SD = $\sqrt{8}$ $\approx$ 2.83

**Coefficient of Variation**: CV = (s/mean) × 100%

## Data Distributions

### Normal Distribution
- Bell-shaped, symmetric
- Mean = Median = Mode
- 68% within 1 SD, 95% within 2 SD, 99.7% within 3 SD
- Many statistical tests assume normality

### Skewness
- **Positive skew**: Tail extends to right
- **Negative skew**: Tail extends to left
- **Symmetric**: No skew

## 3. Probability Theory {#probability}

# Module 3: Probability Theory

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic probability concepts
- Calculate probabilities using different rules
- Work with common probability distributions
- Understand conditional probability and independence
- Apply Bayes' theorem

## Basic Probability Concepts

### Probability
**Definition**: Measure of likelihood that an event will occur

**Range**: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
- P(A) = 0: Impossible event
- P(A) = 1: Certain event

### Sample Space
**Definition**: All possible outcomes of an experiment

**Examples**:
- Coin flip: {Heads, Tails}
- Die roll: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

### Events
- **Simple event**: Single outcome
- **Compound event**: Combination of outcomes
- **Mutually exclusive**: Cannot occur together
- **Independent**: Occurrence doesn't affect other events

## Probability Rules

### Addition Rule
**For mutually exclusive events**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

**For non-mutually exclusive events**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

### Multiplication Rule
**For independent events**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

**For dependent events**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)

### Complement Rule
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

### Conditional Probability
**Formula**: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

**Example**: Probability of having disease given positive test

## Bayes' Theorem

### Formula
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / P(B)

### Extended Form
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / [P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A')]

### Applications
- Medical diagnosis
- Spam filtering
- Risk assessment
- Quality control

## Common Probability Distributions

### Discrete Distributions

#### Binomial Distribution
- Fixed number of trials (n)
- Each trial: success/failure
- Constant probability of success (p)
- Independent trials

**Mean**: $\mu = n \times p$
**Variance**: $\sigma^2 = n \times p \times (1-p)$

**Example**: Number of heads in 10 coin flips

#### Poisson Distribution
- Counts rare events
- Events occur randomly over time/space
- Constant average rate (λ)

**Mean = Variance = λ**

**Example**: Number of accidents per day

### Continuous Distributions

#### Normal Distribution
- Bell-shaped, symmetric
- Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)
- 68-95-99.7 rule

**Standard Normal**: $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$
**Z-score**: $z = (x - \mu) / \sigma$

#### t-Distribution
- Similar to normal but with heavier tails
- Used for small samples
- Degrees of freedom = n - 1

#### Chi-Square Distribution
- Sum of squared standard normal variables
- Used for goodness of fit and independence tests
- Degrees of freedom vary

## Expected Value and Variance

### Expected Value (Mean)
**Discrete**: E[X] = Σ x × P(x)

**Continuous**: E[X] = ∫ x × f(x) dx

### Variance
Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])²

### Properties
- E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b
- Var(aX + b) = a²Var(X)
- Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) (if independent)

## Summary

Probability theory provides the foundation for statistical inference. Understanding probability rules, distributions, and concepts like conditional probability and Bayes' theorem is essential for advanced statistical analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Confidence Intervals

### Concept
- Range of values likely to contain true population parameter
- Based on sample data and desired confidence level

### Formula for Mean (σ known)
CI = $\bar{x} \pm z \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

### Formula for Mean (σ unknown)
CI = $\bar{x} \pm t \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

### Formula for Proportion
CI = $p \pm z \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$

### Interpretation
- 95% CI: 95% confidence that interval contains true parameter
- Wider intervals: More uncertainty
- Factors affecting width: Sample size, variability, confidence level

## Hypothesis Testing

### Steps in Hypothesis Testing
1. **State hypotheses**
   - H₀: Null hypothesis (no effect/difference)
   - H₁: Alternative hypothesis (effect/difference exists)

2. **Choose significance level (α)**
   - Common values: 0.05, 0.01, 0.10

3. **Select test statistic**

4. **Determine critical value or p-value**

5. **Make decision**
   - Reject H₀ if p < α
   - Fail to reject H₀ if $p \geq \alpha$

### Types of Errors
- **Type I Error (α)**: Reject true H₀ (false positive)
- **Type II Error (β)**: Fail to reject false H₀ (false negative)
- **Power (1-β)**: Probability of correctly rejecting false H₀

### Power Analysis
**Factors affecting power**:
- Sample size (primary factor)
- Effect size
- Significance level (α)
- Variability

**Sample size formula**: n = [(zα + zβ)/δ]² × σ²

## Common Statistical Tests

### Parametric Tests (Normal data, equal variances)

#### One-sample t-test
- Compare sample mean to known value
- H₀: μ = μ₀

#### Two-sample t-test
- Compare means of two groups
- Independent samples or paired

#### One-way ANOVA
- Compare means of three or more groups
- Tests if at least one group differs

#### Pearson Correlation
- Measure linear relationship between variables
- Range: -1 to +1

### Non-parametric Tests (No normality assumption)

#### Chi-square test
- Test independence of categorical variables
- Goodness of fit

#### Mann-Whitney U test
- Compare two independent groups
- Alternative to t-test

#### Kruskal-Wallis test
- Compare three or more independent groups
- Alternative to ANOVA

#### Spearman correlation
- Measure monotonic relationship
- Alternative to Pearson correlation

## p-Values and Significance

### p-Value Definition
- Probability of observing data as extreme as sample data, assuming H₀ true
- Smaller p-values: Stronger evidence against H₀

### Significance Levels
- **p < 0.05**: Statistically significant
- **p < 0.01**: Highly significant
- **p < 0.001**: Very highly significant

### Misconceptions
- p-value $\neq$ probability that H₀ is true
- p-value $\neq$ importance of result
- Statistical significance $\neq$ clinical significance

## Effect Size

### Importance
- Magnitude of relationship or difference
- Independent of sample size
- More meaningful than p-values

### Common Measures
- **Cohen's d**: Standardized mean difference
- **Odds ratio**: For categorical outcomes
- **Relative risk**: For incidence data
- **R²**: Proportion of variance explained

## Summary

Inferential statistics allow us to make conclusions about populations from sample data. Confidence intervals provide estimates with uncertainty, while hypothesis testing helps determine if observed effects are real. Understanding Type I/II errors, power, and effect sizes is crucial for proper interpretation of statistical results.

**Example**: Test if average height differs from national average

### Independent Samples t-Test
**Purpose**: Compare means of two independent groups

**Formula**: t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) / \sqrt{(s₁²/n₁) + (s₂²/n₂)}

**Assumptions**:
- Independent observations
- Normal distribution in each group
- Equal variances (or use Welch's correction)

### Paired t-Test

**Formula**: t = (x̄_d) / (s_d / \sqrt{n})

Where x̄_d is mean of differences

**Uses**:
- Before-after studies
- Matched pairs
- Repeated measures

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

### One-Way ANOVA
**Purpose**: Compare means of three or more groups

**Logic**: Partition total variation into between-group and within-group

**F-statistic**: F = MS_between / MS_within

## 1. Introduction to Epidemiological Study Designs {#introduction}

# Module 1: Introduction to Epidemiological Study Designs

## Learning Objectives
- Define epidemiology and its role in public health
- Understand the basic principles of epidemiological research
- Differentiate between descriptive and analytical epidemiology
- Identify the key components of epidemiological study designs
- Understand the importance of study design in establishing causality

## What is Epidemiology?

Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems.

**Key terms:**
- **Distribution**: Who, when, where of health events
- **Determinants**: Causes and risk factors
- **Health-related states**: Diseases, injuries, disabilities, deaths
- **Specified populations**: Defined groups of people
- **Control**: Prevention and intervention

## Levels of Epidemiological Study

### 1. Descriptive Epidemiology
- Describes the distribution of disease in terms of person, place, and time
- Answers: Who gets the disease? Where? When?
- Does not test hypotheses about causes
- Useful for generating hypotheses and planning interventions

### 2. Analytical Epidemiology
- Examines associations between exposures and outcomes
- Tests hypotheses about causal relationships
- Determines whether associations are causal

## Epidemiological Study Designs

Study designs are classified based on:
- **Timing**: Prospective vs. Retrospective
- **Direction of inquiry**: Forward vs. Backward
- **Manipulation of exposure**: Observational vs. Experimental

### Major Categories:
1. **Observational Studies**: Researcher observes without intervention
   - Descriptive studies
   - Analytical observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional)

2. **Experimental Studies**: Researcher intervenes or manipulates exposure
   - Clinical trials
   - Field trials
   - Community trials

## Key Principles in Epidemiological Research

### 1. Study Population
- Clearly defined population from which subjects are drawn
- Target population vs. study population vs. source population

### 2. Exposure and Outcome
- **Exposure**: Factor of interest (risk factor, intervention)
- **Outcome**: Health event or condition being studied
- Clear definitions essential for validity

### 3. Comparison Groups
- Essential for analytical studies
- Exposed vs. unexposed groups
- Cases vs. controls

### 4. Bias and Confounding
- Threats to validity that must be controlled
- Bias: Systematic error in design, conduct, or analysis
- Confounding: Mixing of effects of exposure with other factors

## Establishing Causality

### Bradford Hill Criteria (1965)
1. **Strength of association**: Strong associations more likely causal
2. **Consistency**: Findings replicated in different studies/settings
3. **Specificity**: Exposure leads to specific outcome
4. **Temporality**: Exposure precedes outcome
5. **Biological gradient**: Dose-response relationship
6. **Plausibility**: Biologically credible
7. **Coherence**: Fits with existing knowledge
8. **Experiment**: Experimental evidence supports
9. **Analogy**: Similar to known causal relationships

## Importance of Study Design Selection

- Different research questions require different designs
- Each design has strengths and limitations
- Choice affects validity, precision, and generalizability
- Ethical considerations influence design selection

## Summary

Epidemiological study designs provide the framework for investigating health-related questions. Understanding the principles of epidemiology and the characteristics of different study designs is essential for conducting valid research and critically appraising published studies.

***

## 2. Observational Study Designs {#observational-studies}

# Module 2: Observational Study Designs

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the characteristics of different observational study designs
- Understand the strengths and limitations of each design
- Identify appropriate situations for using each design
- Calculate and interpret measures of association

## Overview of Observational Studies

Observational studies involve observation of subjects without manipulation of exposure by the researcher. They are essential when experimental designs are unethical, impractical, or impossible.

## 1. Descriptive Studies

### Ecological Studies
- **Definition**: Study of groups or populations rather than individuals
- **Unit of analysis**: Groups (countries, regions, communities)
- **Data sources**: Routinely collected data (mortality rates, disease registries)

**Example**: Correlation between per capita fat consumption and breast cancer rates across countries

**Advantages:**
- Inexpensive and quick
- Use existing data
- Good for hypothesis generation

**Limitations:**
- **Ecological fallacy**: Associations at group level may not reflect individual level
- Cannot establish causality
- Confounding at individual level

**Measures:**
- Correlation coefficients
- Rates and proportions

### Case Reports and Case Series
- **Case Report**: Detailed description of single case
- **Case Series**: Description of multiple similar cases
- **Purpose**: Describe unusual presentations, generate hypotheses
- **Limitations**: No comparison group, cannot establish causality

## 2. Analytical Observational Studies

### Cohort Studies

#### Prospective Cohort Studies
- **Definition**: Follow groups of people who are free of disease forward in time
- **Exposure assessment**: Before outcome occurs
- **Direction**: Forward in time

**Example**: Framingham Heart Study - followed healthy individuals to study cardiovascular risk factors

**Advantages:**
- Can study multiple outcomes
- Exposure precedes outcome (temporality)
- Can calculate incidence rates
- Good for rare exposures

**Limitations:**
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Loss to follow-up
- Changes in exposure classification over time
- Not suitable for rare outcomes

**Measures of Association:**
- **Relative Risk (RR)**: Incidence in exposed / Incidence in unexposed
- **Attributable Risk**: Excess risk due to exposure
- **Attributable Fraction**: Proportion of disease due to exposure

#### Retrospective (Historical) Cohort Studies
- **Definition**: Use existing records to reconstruct cohorts
- **Exposure assessment**: From historical records
- **Direction**: Backward in time from outcome

**Example**: Occupational studies using employment records

**Advantages:**
- Quicker and cheaper than prospective studies
- Can study past exposures
- Good for rare exposures

**Limitations:**
- Dependent on quality of historical records
- Exposure misclassification possible
- Cannot study new exposures

### Case-Control Studies

#### Definition
- **Study base**: Population that gives rise to cases
- **Cases**: Individuals with the outcome of interest
- **Controls**: Individuals without the outcome, from same study base

**Example**: Study of lung cancer cases and controls to examine smoking history

**Advantages:**
- Efficient for rare outcomes
- Can study multiple exposures
- Relatively quick and inexpensive
- Good for studying diseases with long latency

**Limitations:**
- Cannot calculate incidence rates
- Prone to recall bias
- Selection bias possible
- Not suitable for rare exposures

**Measures of Association:**
- **Odds Ratio (OR)**: (Cases exposed/Cases unexposed) / (Controls exposed/Controls unexposed)
- When disease is rare, OR $\approx$ RR

#### Types of Case-Control Studies
1. **Population-based**: Cases and controls from defined population
2. **Hospital-based**: Cases from hospitals, controls from same hospitals
3. **Nested case-control**: Within a cohort study

### Cross-Sectional Studies

#### Definition
- **Prevalence study**: Measures prevalence of exposure and outcome at single point in time
- **Direction**: Neither forward nor backward - both exposure and outcome measured simultaneously

**Example**: National Health Survey measuring current smoking and current health status

**Advantages:**
- Quick and inexpensive
- Can study multiple outcomes and exposures
- Good for hypothesis generation

## Choosing an Observational Study Design

### Factors to Consider:
1. **Research question**: What is the exposure? What is the outcome?
2. **Frequency**: How common are exposure and outcome?
3. **Time**: When did exposure/outcome occur?
4. **Resources**: Time and budget available
5. **Feasibility**: Can the study be conducted?

### Decision Framework:

| Scenario | Preferred Design |
|*********-|******************|
| Rare outcome, common exposure | Cohort study |
| Rare outcome, rare exposure | Case-control study |
| Common outcome, common exposure | Cross-sectional study |
| Multiple outcomes, single exposure | Cohort study |
| Multiple exposures, single outcome | Case-control study |
| Quick assessment needed | Cross-sectional study |

## Summary

Each observational study design has unique strengths and limitations. The choice of design depends on the research question, the frequency of exposure and outcome, available resources, and feasibility. Understanding these designs is crucial for both conducting research and critically appraising published studies.

# Module 3: Experimental Study Designs

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the characteristics of experimental study designs
- Understand randomization and its importance
- Identify different types of experimental studies
- Recognize ethical considerations in experimental research
- Calculate and interpret results from experimental studies

## Overview of Experimental Studies

Experimental studies involve active manipulation of exposure by the researcher. They are considered the "gold standard" for establishing causality because they can control for confounding and establish temporality.

**Key features:**
- Manipulation of exposure
- Random allocation to groups
- Control group for comparison
- Prospective design

## Clinical Trials

### Definition
Clinical trials are experimental studies conducted in clinical settings to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interventions in human subjects.

### Phases of Clinical Trials
1. **Phase I**: Safety, dosage, pharmacokinetics (small number of healthy volunteers)
2. **Phase II**: Efficacy and side effects (small number of patients)
3. **Phase III**: Large-scale evaluation of efficacy and safety (hundreds to thousands of patients)
4. **Phase IV**: Post-marketing surveillance (ongoing monitoring after approval)

### Types of Clinical Trials

#### 1. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
- **Definition**: Participants randomly assigned to intervention or control groups
- **Gold standard** for clinical research

**Components:**
- **Randomization**: Ensures groups are comparable
- **Control group**: Receives placebo or standard treatment
- **Blinding**: Single-blind, double-blind, triple-blind
- **Intention-to-treat analysis**: Analyzes participants as originally assigned

**Advantages:**
- Minimizes confounding
- Establishes temporality
- Can measure multiple outcomes
- High internal validity

**Limitations:**
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Ethical constraints
- May not be generalizable
- Loss to follow-up

**Example**: RCT comparing new drug vs. placebo for hypertension

#### 2. Non-Randomized Controlled Trials
- **Definition**: Participants assigned to groups without randomization
- **Methods**: Alternate allocation, physician preference, etc.

**Advantages:**
- Easier to implement
- Less expensive

**Limitations:**
- Potential for selection bias
- Groups may not be comparable

#### 3. Crossover Trials
- **Definition**: Each participant receives both intervention and control in sequence
- **Design**: A-B vs. B-A or A-B vs. A-C

**Advantages:**
- Each participant serves as own control
- Requires fewer participants
- Controls for individual differences

**Limitations:**
- Carryover effects
- Not suitable for irreversible outcomes
- Dropout between periods

**Example**: Trial comparing two pain medications where each patient tries both

#### 4. Cluster Randomized Trials
- **Definition**: Groups (clusters) rather than individuals are randomized
- **Examples**: Schools, clinics, communities

**Advantages:**
- Practical for community interventions
- Reduces contamination between groups
- Cost-effective

**Limitations:**
- Requires larger sample size
- Potential for cluster-level confounding

### Field Trials and Community Trials

#### Field Trials
- **Definition**: Experimental studies conducted in field settings
- **Examples**: Vaccine trials in developing countries
- **Similar to RCTs but in natural settings**

#### Community Trials
- **Definition**: Interventions applied to entire communities
- **Examples**: Water fluoridation, community health programs
- **Unit of randomization**: Communities or groups

**Advantages:**
- High external validity
- Can study population-level effects
- Ethical for public health interventions

**Limitations:**
- Difficult to control confounding
- Hawthorne effect
- Contamination between groups

## Key Principles of Experimental Design

### 1. Randomization
- **Purpose**: Creates comparable groups
- **Methods**:
  - Simple randomization
  - Block randomization (stratified)
  - Cluster randomization
  - Minimization

**Importance:**
- Balances both known and unknown confounders
- Allows for statistical inference
- Reduces selection bias

### 2. Blinding/Masking
- **Single-blind**: Participant unaware of assignment
- **Double-blind**: Participant and investigator unaware
- **Triple-blind**: Participant, investigator, and analyst unaware

**Purpose:**
- Reduces performance bias
- Reduces detection bias
- Improves validity

### 3. Control Groups
- **Placebo control**: Inert substance
- **Active control**: Standard treatment
- **No treatment control**: Ethical only when no standard exists
- **Historical control**: Uses past data (not recommended)

### 4. Sample Size and Power
- **Power**: Probability of detecting true effect
- **Factors affecting power**: Sample size, effect size, variability, significance level
- **Sample size calculation**: Based on desired power and effect size

## Ethical Considerations

### Key Principles (Declaration of Helsinki)
1. **Respect for persons**: Autonomy and informed consent
2. **Beneficence**: Maximize benefits, minimize harms
3. **Justice**: Fair distribution of benefits and burdens

### Informed Consent
- **Elements**:
  - Disclosure of information
  - Comprehension
  - Voluntariness
  - Competence

### Equipoise
- **Clinical equipoise**: Genuine uncertainty about which intervention is better
- **Community equipoise**: Uncertainty at community level

### Special Considerations
- **Vulnerable populations**: Children, prisoners, mentally ill
- **Placebo use**: When no proven treatment exists
- **Emergency research**: Waiver of consent in emergencies

## Analysis of Experimental Studies

### Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis
- **Definition**: Analyzes participants as originally randomized
- **Purpose**: Preserves randomization, reduces bias
- **Advantages**: More conservative, reflects real-world effectiveness

### Per-Protocol Analysis
- **Definition**: Analyzes only participants who completed treatment as assigned
- **Purpose**: Estimates efficacy under ideal conditions
- **Limitations**: Can introduce bias

### Measures of Effect
- **Risk Difference (RD)**: Risk in intervention - Risk in control
- **Relative Risk (RR)**: Risk in intervention / Risk in control
- **Odds Ratio (OR)**: Odds in intervention / Odds in control
- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**: 1 / RD

## Limitations and Challenges

### Internal Validity Threats
- **Attrition bias**: Differential loss to follow-up
- **Non-compliance**: Participants not following protocol
- **Contamination**: Control group receives intervention
- **Co-intervention**: Additional treatments affect outcome

### External Validity
- **Generalizability**: Can results apply to other populations?
- **Factors affecting**: Study population, setting, intervention delivery

### Practical Challenges
- **Cost and time**: RCTs are expensive and slow
- **Feasibility**: Not all questions can be studied experimentally
- **Ethical constraints**: Cannot study harmful exposures

## Summary

Experimental studies provide the strongest evidence for causality due to randomization and control. However, they are not always feasible or ethical. Understanding experimental designs is crucial for both conducting clinical research and critically appraising the medical literature.
# Module 4: Bias in Epidemiological Research

## Learning Objectives
- Define different types of bias in epidemiological studies
- Understand how bias affects study validity
- Identify sources of bias in different study designs
- Learn methods to minimize bias in study design and conduct

## What is Bias?

**Bias** is systematic error that leads to incorrect estimates of association between exposure and outcome.

**Key characteristics:**
- Systematic (not random)
- Leads to incorrect conclusions
- Can inflate or deflate associations
- Threatens validity

**Types of validity:**
- **Internal validity**: Study measures what it intends to measure
- **External validity**: Results can be generalized to other populations

## Classification of Bias

### 1. Selection Bias

Selection bias occurs when the relationship between exposure and outcome differs between selected study participants and the target population.

#### Types of Selection Bias

**A. Sampling Bias**
- **Definition**: Sample not representative of target population
- **Examples**:
  - Hospital-based controls not representative of population
  - Volunteer bias in cohort studies
  - Non-response bias in surveys

**B. Berkson's Bias (Admission Rate Bias)**
- **Definition**: Hospital controls may not represent the general population
- **Reason**: Hospitalized people have higher disease rates
- **Example**: Studying risk factors for disease X using hospitalized controls

**C. Healthy Worker Effect**
- **Definition**: Working populations appear healthier than general population
- **Reason**: Unhealthy people less likely to be employed
- **Example**: Occupational studies showing lower mortality in workers

**D. Self-Selection Bias**
- **Definition**: Participants choose their own exposure
- **Example**: Exercise intervention where motivated people enroll

**E. Loss to Follow-up Bias**
- **Definition**: Differential loss to follow-up between groups
- **Example**: In cohort studies, exposed participants drop out more than unexposed

#### Prevention of Selection Bias
- Random sampling from defined population
- Matching cases and controls on important variables
- High follow-up rates
- Intention-to-treat analysis in RCTs

### 2. Information Bias (Measurement Bias)

Information bias occurs when information about exposure or outcome is collected or interpreted differently between comparison groups.

#### Types of Information Bias

**A. Recall Bias**
- **Definition**: Differential recall of past exposures
- **Common in**: Case-control studies
- **Example**: Cancer patients recall exposures better than controls
- **Prevention**: Use objective measures, blinded interviewers

**B. Observer Bias (Detection Bias)**
- **Definition**: Outcome assessment differs between groups
- **Example**: Knowing exposure status affects diagnosis
- **Prevention**: Blinding, standardized criteria

**C. Interviewer Bias**
- **Definition**: Interviewer knowledge affects questioning
- **Prevention**: Training, blinding, standardized questionnaires

**D. Misclassification Bias**
- **Definition**: Incorrect classification of exposure or outcome
- **Types**:
  - **Non-differential**: Equal misclassification in both groups (biases toward null)
  - **Differential**: Unequal misclassification between groups (can bias in either direction)

**Examples of Misclassification:**
- Exposure misclassification: Self-reported smoking vs. cotinine levels
- Outcome misclassification: Different diagnostic criteria used

**E. Confounding by Indication**
- **Definition**: Treatment indication mistaken for treatment effect
- **Example**: Sicker patients get treatment, appear to have worse outcomes

#### Prevention of Information Bias
- Standardized data collection
- Blinding
- Objective measurements
- Validation studies
- Training of observers

### 3. Confounding Bias

**Definition**: Mixing of the effect of exposure with the effect of another variable (confounder)

**Characteristics of a Confounder:**
1. Associated with exposure
2. Independently associated with outcome
3. Not in causal pathway between exposure and outcome

**Example**: Age as confounder in smoking-lung cancer association
- Older people more likely to smoke (associated with exposure)
- Older people more likely to develop lung cancer (associated with outcome)
- Age is not caused by smoking

**Note**: Confounding is discussed in detail in Module 5

## Bias in Different Study Designs

### Cohort Studies
**Common biases:**
- Selection bias: Healthy worker effect, self-selection
- Information bias: Differential loss to follow-up, recall bias (retrospective)
- Confounding: Important issue

### Case-Control Studies
**Common biases:**
- Selection bias: Berkson's bias, inappropriate controls
- Information bias: Recall bias, interviewer bias
- Confounding: Important issue

### Cross-Sectional Studies
**Common biases:**
- Selection bias: Non-response
- Information bias: Simultaneous measurement issues
- Prevalence-incidence bias

### Experimental Studies
**Common biases:**
- Selection bias: Non-random assignment
- Information bias: Lack of blinding
- Performance bias: Different care between groups

## Quantifying the Impact of Bias

### Direction of Bias
- **Bias toward null**: Association underestimated (non-differential misclassification)
- **Bias away from null**: Association overestimated

### Magnitude of Bias
Depends on:
- Prevalence of bias
- Strength of association between bias factor and outcome
- Difference in bias between groups

## Methods to Minimize Bias

### Study Design Level
1. **Randomization**: Balances known and unknown confounders
2. **Matching**: Ensures comparability on key variables
3. **Blinding**: Prevents observer and performance bias
4. **Prospective design**: Reduces recall bias

### Data Collection Level
1. **Standardized protocols**: Consistent data collection
2. **Training**: Ensures quality and consistency
3. **Quality control**: Monitoring and validation
4. **Objective measures**: When possible, use biological markers

### Analysis Level
1. **Restriction**: Limit analysis to homogeneous subgroups
2. **Matching**: In analysis (frequency matching, individual matching)
3. **Stratification**: Examine effect in strata of confounder
4. **Statistical adjustment**: Regression models, standardization

## Assessing Bias in Published Studies

### Critical Appraisal Questions
1. **Selection bias**: Was selection systematic? Representative sample?
2. **Information bias**: Were measurements objective? Blinded assessment?
3. **Confounding**: Were important confounders measured and controlled?
4. **Other biases**: Reporting bias, publication bias?

### Sensitivity Analysis
- **Definition**: Test how robust results are to different assumptions about bias
- **Methods**: Vary assumptions about misclassification rates
- **Purpose**: Assess potential impact of bias on conclusions

## Common Sources of Bias in Epidemiological Research

### Publication Bias
- **Definition**: Studies with significant results more likely to be published
- **Impact**: Overestimation of effects
- **Prevention**: Register trials, publish protocols, include all results

### Reporting Bias
- **Definition**: Selective reporting of outcomes or analyses
- **Prevention**: Publish protocols, report all outcomes

### Time-Related Biases
- **Immortal time bias**: Follow-up time misclassified
- **Lead time bias**: Earlier diagnosis appears to prolong survival
- **Length bias**: Slow-growing tumors more likely detected by screening

## Summary

Bias is a major threat to the validity of epidemiological studies. Understanding different types of bias and their sources is essential for both designing studies and critically appraising research. While some bias can be prevented through good study design, other biases must be controlled through analysis or acknowledged as limitations.
# Module 5: Confounding and Interaction

## Learning Objectives
- Define confounding and understand its impact on study results
- Identify confounders in epidemiological studies
- Learn methods to control for confounding
- Understand effect modification (interaction)
- Distinguish between confounding and interaction

## Confounding

### Definition
**Confounding** is a mixing of effects where the apparent association between exposure and outcome is distorted by the effect of a third variable (confounder).

### Characteristics of a Confounder
A variable is a confounder if it meets ALL THREE criteria:

1. **Associated with exposure**: Confounder must be related to the exposure of interest
2. **Independently associated with outcome**: Confounder must affect the outcome
3. **Not in the causal pathway**: Confounder should not be an intermediate variable

### Example: Smoking and Lung Cancer
```
Age $\rightarrow$ Smoking $\rightarrow$ Lung Cancer
     $\uparrow$
     $\downarrow$ Confounder: Age is associated with both smoking and lung cancer
```

- Older people are more likely to smoke (age associated with exposure)
- Older people are more likely to develop lung cancer (age associated with outcome)
- Age is not caused by smoking (not in causal pathway)

**Crude association**: Smoking appears strongly associated with lung cancer
**After controlling for age**: The association is weaker but still present

## Types of Confounding

### 1. Positive Confounding
- Confounder increases the apparent association
- Example: Age in smoking-lung cancer association

### 2. Negative Confounding
- Confounder decreases the apparent association
- Example: Socioeconomic status in some associations

### 3. Quantifying Confounding
- **Confounding bias**: Difference between crude and adjusted estimates
- **Percent change**: [(Crude RR - Adjusted RR) / Crude RR] × 100

## Methods to Control Confounding

### 1. Study Design Level

#### A. Randomization
- **How it works**: Balances confounders across groups
- **Best method**: In experimental studies
- **Limitations**: Not always possible (observational studies)

#### B. Restriction
- **Definition**: Limit study to participants with similar levels of confounder
- **Example**: Study only adults aged 40-60 to control for age
- **Advantages**: Simple, effective
- **Limitations**: Reduces generalizability, may not control multiple confounders

#### C. Matching
- **Definition**: Select controls similar to cases on confounding variables
- **Types**:
  - **Individual matching**: Each case matched to specific control(s)
  - **Frequency matching**: Controls selected to match case distribution
- **Example**: Match cases and controls by age and sex
- **Advantages**: Ensures balance on matched variables
- **Limitations**: Can only match on known confounders, matching on too many variables difficult

### 2. Analysis Level

#### A. Stratification
- **Definition**: Analyze data separately within strata of the confounder
- **Example**: Calculate association separately for different age groups
- **Mantel-Haenszel method**: Combines stratum-specific estimates
- **Advantages**: Simple, shows effect modification
- **Limitations**: Limited to few confounders

#### B. Statistical Adjustment
- **Multivariable regression**: Controls for multiple confounders simultaneously
- **Types**:
  - Linear regression (continuous outcomes)
  - Logistic regression (binary outcomes)
  - Cox regression (time-to-event outcomes)
- **Advantages**: Can control many confounders, handles continuous variables
- **Limitations**: Requires assumptions, can over-adjust

#### C. Standardization
- **Direct standardization**: Apply study rates to standard population
- **Indirect standardization**: Compare observed vs. expected rates
- **Purpose**: Compare rates across populations with different age structures

## Effect Modification (Interaction)

### Definition
**Effect modification** occurs when the association between exposure and outcome differs across levels of a third variable.

### Key Differences from Confounding

| Aspect | Confounding | Effect Modification |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Effect on association** | Distorts the association | Changes the association |
| **Control method** | Should be controlled | Should NOT be controlled |
| **Interpretation** | Single effect estimate | Separate estimates for subgroups |
| **Terminology** | Confounder | Effect modifier |

### Example: Exercise and Heart Disease
```
Exercise $\rightarrow$ Heart Disease
$\uparrow$
Sex (Effect Modifier)
```

- In men: Exercise reduces heart disease risk by 30%
- In women: Exercise reduces heart disease risk by 50%
- Overall: Exercise reduces heart disease risk by 40%

### Types of Interaction

#### 1. Quantitative Interaction
- **Definition**: Direction of association same, but magnitude differs
- **Example**: Drug effect stronger in younger patients

#### 2. Qualitative Interaction
- **Definition**: Direction of association differs between subgroups
- **Example**: Treatment beneficial in men but harmful in women

### Testing for Interaction

#### 1. Stratified Analysis
- Calculate effect estimates in each stratum
- Compare estimates across strata
- Look for statistical significance of interaction term

#### 2. Statistical Tests
- **Interaction term** in regression models
- **Likelihood ratio test**: Compare models with/without interaction
- **Wald test**: Test significance of interaction coefficient

#### 3. Graphical Methods
- **Effect plots**: Show how association changes across levels of modifier
- **Interaction plots**: Lines that cross or diverge indicate interaction

## Confounding vs. Interaction: Decision Framework

### Is the third variable a confounder or effect modifier?

1. **Biological plausibility**: Does it make sense that the variable modifies the effect?
2. **Consistency**: Is the pattern seen in other studies?
3. **Statistical evidence**: Is there significant interaction?
4. **Clinical importance**: Does it change clinical decisions?

### Example: Age in a Drug Study
- **Confounding**: Age associated with both drug use and outcome
- **Effect modification**: Drug works differently in young vs. old patients

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Confounding by Indication
- **Definition**: Treatment appears harmful because sicker patients receive it
- **Example**: Drug appears to cause worse outcomes because given to severe cases
- **Control**: Instrumental variable analysis, propensity scores

### 2. Residual Confounding
- **Definition**: Confounding not fully controlled due to measurement error
- **Example**: Age categorized as 20-40, 41-60, but true effect varies within categories
- **Prevention**: Better measurement, more categories

### 3. Over-adjustment
- **Definition**: Controlling for variables in the causal pathway
- **Example**: Controlling for intermediate variables weakens true associations
- **Prevention**: Careful consideration of causal diagrams

### 4. Collider Bias
- **Definition**: Conditioning on a collider creates spurious associations
- **Example**: Studying factors associated with hospital admission creates associations between unrelated conditions

## Practical Applications

### 1. Causal Diagrams (DAGs)
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs**: Visual representation of causal relationships
- **Purpose**: Identify confounders, mediators, colliders
- **Use**: Guide analysis and control strategies

### 2. Propensity Scores
- **Definition**: Probability of exposure given covariates
- **Methods**: Logistic regression to estimate propensity
- **Uses**: Matching, stratification, weighting
- **Advantages**: Control many confounders simultaneously

### 3. Instrumental Variable Analysis
- **Definition**: Use instrumental variables to estimate causal effects
- **Requirements**: Instrument associated with exposure, affects outcome only through exposure
- **Example**: Physician preference as instrument for treatment choice

## Summary

Confounding and interaction are critical concepts in epidemiology. Confounding distorts associations and must be controlled, while effect modification reveals important heterogeneity in effects that should be explored. Understanding these concepts is essential for valid epidemiological research and appropriate interpretation of study results.

- **Competing risks**: Other outcomes affect results

#### Example Appraisal:
**Study**: Coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes

**Strengths**: Large prospective cohort, objective outcome assessment
**Limitations**: Self-reported coffee consumption, residual confounding

### Case-Control Studies

#### Key Questions:
1. **Case definition**: Clear, consistent criteria?
2. **Control selection**: Appropriate source population?
3. **Exposure assessment**: Recall bias minimized?
4. **Matching**: Appropriate variables matched?
5. **Response rates**: High participation?
6. **Analysis**: Conditional vs. unconditional logistic regression?

#### Common Issues:
- **Recall bias**: Cases remember exposures better
- **Selection bias**: Controls not representative
- **Confounding by indication**: Disease severity affects exposure

#### Example Appraisal:
**Study**: Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism

**Strengths**: Population-based, validated outcomes
**Limitations**: Potential recall bias, confounding by smoking

### Cross-Sectional Studies

#### Key Questions:
1. **Sampling**: Random? Representative?
2. **Measurement timing**: Exposure and outcome measured simultaneously?
3. **Response rates**: High participation?
4. **Analysis**: Appropriate for cross-sectional design?

#### Limitations:
- **Temporality**: Cannot determine cause-effect
- **Prevalence-incidence bias**: Mix of prevalent and incident cases
- **Survival bias**: Only survivors included

## Critical Appraisal of Experimental Studies

### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

#### Key Questions:
1. **Randomization**: Adequate method? Concealed allocation?
2. **Blinding**: Participants, investigators, assessors blinded?
3. **Groups comparable**: Baseline characteristics similar?
4. **Intervention**: Clearly described? Compliance monitored?
5. **Outcome assessment**: Objective? Blinded?
6. **Analysis**: Intention-to-treat? Handling of missing data?
7. **Follow-up**: Complete? Differential loss?

#### Quality Assessment (Jadad Scale):
- **Randomization**: Adequate method (+1), inadequate (-1)
- **Blinding**: Adequate method (+1), inadequate (-1)
- **Withdrawals**: Described (+1)
- **Maximum score**: 5 points

#### Common Biases:
- **Performance bias**: Different care between groups
- **Attrition bias**: Differential dropouts
- **Reporting bias**: Selective outcome reporting

### Non-Randomized Trials

#### Additional Questions:
1. **Assignment method**: How were groups formed?
2. **Baseline differences**: Statistical adjustment performed?
3. **Confounding**: Important confounders controlled?

#### Limitations:
- **Selection bias**: Groups not comparable
- **Confounding**: Unmeasured confounders
- **Lower evidence quality**: GRADE approach

## Assessing Risk of Bias

### Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (for RCTs)
1. **Selection bias**: Random sequence generation, allocation concealment
2. **Performance bias**: Blinding of participants and personnel
3. **Detection bias**: Blinding of outcome assessment
4. **Attrition bias**: Incomplete outcome data
5. **Reporting bias**: Selective reporting
6. **Other bias**: Other sources of bias

### ROBINS-I Tool (for Non-Randomized Studies)
- **Domains**: Confounding, selection, classification, deviation, missing data, measurement, reporting
- **Overall risk**: Low, moderate, serious, critical, no information

## Evaluating Precision and Validity

### Precision
- **Confidence intervals**: Narrow vs. wide
- **P-values**: Statistical significance vs. clinical importance
- **Sample size**: Adequate power?
