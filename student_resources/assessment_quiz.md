## Answer Key

### Section 1
1. B) Case-control study
2. C) Randomized controlled trial
3. C) Case-control
4. Cohort: can establish temporality; Case-control: efficient for rare outcomes; Cross-sectional: cannot determine cause-effect; RCT: gold standard for causality
5. False
6. B) Case-control study

### Section 2
7. Confounding is a mixing of effects where a third variable distorts the relationship between exposure and outcome. Example: Age confounds the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.
8. C) In the causal pathway between exposure and outcome
9. B) Information bias (specifically recall bias)
10. C) Randomization
11. False (effect modification should NOT be controlled; it should be explored)
12. Berkson's bias occurs when hospital controls are not representative of the general population because hospitalized people have higher disease rates.
13. B) Differential

### Section 3
14. RR = 20/10 = 2.0
15. B) When disease is rare
16. B) How well the study measures what it intends
17. False
18. AF = (2.0 - 1)/2.0 = 0.5 or 50%

### Section 4
19. Possible answers: Was randomization adequate? Were participants blinded? Was there complete follow-up? Was intention-to-treat analysis used? Were groups similar at baseline?
20. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
21. B) GRADE
22. True
23. To test how robust conclusions are to different assumptions about bias or missing data

## Grading Rubric

- **90-100%**: Excellent understanding of epidemiological concepts
- **80-89%**: Good grasp of most concepts with minor errors
- **70-79%**: Adequate understanding with some misconceptions
- **60-69%**: Basic understanding but significant gaps
- **Below 60%**: Requires additional study and review

## Study Tips
- Review the glossary regularly
- Practice calculating measures of association
- Compare different study designs systematically
- Focus on understanding rather than memorization
- Use real examples to illustrate concepts
