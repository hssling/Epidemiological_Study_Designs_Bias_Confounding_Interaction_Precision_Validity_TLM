# Epidemiology Glossary: Key Terms and Concepts

## A

**Absolute Risk**: The actual probability or rate of developing a disease over a specified time period.

**Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**: The difference in absolute risk between treatment and control groups.

**Analytical Epidemiology**: Studies that examine associations between exposures and outcomes to test hypotheses.

**Association**: Statistical relationship between two variables (exposure and outcome).

**Attributable Fraction (AF)**: Proportion of disease in exposed individuals that can be attributed to the exposure.

**Attributable Risk (AR)**: Excess risk of disease in exposed compared to unexposed individuals.

## B

**Bias**: Systematic error that leads to incorrect estimates of association.

**Blinding**: Concealing group assignment from participants, investigators, or assessors to prevent bias.

## C

**Case**: Individual with the outcome of interest in case-control studies.

**Case-Control Study**: Observational study comparing individuals with disease (cases) to those without (controls).

**Case Series**: Description of multiple similar cases (no comparison group).

**Causal Inference**: Process of determining whether an association represents a true cause-effect relationship.

**Causality**: Bradford Hill Criteria - strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, analogy.

**Cohort**: Group of individuals followed over time in cohort studies.

**Cohort Study**: Observational study following groups forward in time to observe outcomes.

**Comparison Group**: Reference group used to compare outcomes (controls, unexposed).

**Confounding**: Mixing of effects where a third variable distorts the exposure-outcome relationship.

**Non-Differential Misclassification**: Equal misclassification in both groups.

**Non-Response Bias**: Systematic differences between responders and non-responders.

**Null Hypothesis**: No association exists between exposure and outcome.

## O

**Observational Study**: Research observing natural exposures without intervention.

**Odds**: Probability of event divided by probability of non-event.

**Odds Ratio (OR)**: Ratio of odds of exposure in cases vs. controls.

**Outcome**: Health event or condition being studied.

**Over-Adjustment**: Controlling for variables in the causal pathway.

## P

**P-Value**: Probability of observing results if null hypothesis is true.

**Performance Bias**: Systematic differences in care between groups.

**Person-Time**: Measure of time individuals are at risk (person-years, person-months).

**Placebo**: Inactive substance resembling active treatment.

**Placebo Effect**: Improvement due to belief in treatment rather than treatment itself.

**Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**: Proportion of disease in population attributable to exposure.

**Population Attributable Risk (PAR)**: Excess risk in population due to exposure.

**Power**: Probability of detecting true effect when it exists.

**Prevalence**: Number of existing cases in population at a point in time.

## Key Formulas

**Relative Risk (RR)** = Incidence_exposed / Incidence_unexposed

**Odds Ratio (OR)** = (Cases_exposed × Controls_unexposed) / (Cases_unexposed × Controls_exposed)

**Attributable Risk (AR)** = Incidence_exposed - Incidence_unexposed

**Attributable Fraction (AF)** = (RR - 1) / RR × 100%

**Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)** = P_e × (RR - 1) / [P_e × (RR - 1) + 1]

**Confidence Interval**: Point estimate ± (Z × Standard Error)

**Sample Size for Cohort Study**: n = (Zα + Zβ)² × (p1(1-p1) + p2(1-p2)) / (p1-p2)²

Where:
- Zα = Z-score for alpha level (1.96 for 95% CI)
- Zβ = Z-score for power (0.84 for 80% power)
- p1, p2 = proportions in groups
- d = effect size
