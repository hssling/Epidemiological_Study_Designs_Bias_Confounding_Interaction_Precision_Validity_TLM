3. **External Validity**:
   - How representative is the study population?
   - Can results be generalized to other hormone formulations?
   - What about current vs. past use patterns?

4. **Harms vs. Benefits**:
   - What were the beneficial outcomes (osteoporosis, colorectal cancer)?
   - How were multiple outcomes balanced?
   - What was the overall risk-benefit assessment?

5. **Impact on Practice**:
   - How did these results change clinical practice?
   - What were the long-term consequences for women's health?
   - How did subsequent research modify these findings?

## Case Study 3: Mediterranean Diet and Cardiovascular Disease
