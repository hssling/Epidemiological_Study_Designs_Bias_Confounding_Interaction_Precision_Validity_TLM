# Exercise Set 1: Introduction to Epidemiological Study Designs

## Exercise 1.1: Identifying Study Designs

For each research question below, identify the most appropriate epidemiological study design and explain why:

1. **Research Question**: What is the prevalence of hypertension in urban vs. rural populations in India?

2. **Research Question**: Does regular aspirin use reduce the risk of heart attack?

3. **Research Question**: Are children exposed to secondhand smoke at higher risk of respiratory infections?

4. **Research Question**: Does a new vaccine prevent COVID-19 infection?

5. **Research Question**: What are the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health?

## Exercise 1.2: Study Design Characteristics

Match each study design with its key characteristics:

**Study Designs:**
A. Cohort study
B. Case-control study
C. Cross-sectional study
D. Randomized controlled trial
E. Ecological study

**Characteristics:**
1. Can establish temporality
2. Most efficient for rare outcomes
3. Cannot determine cause-effect relationship
4. Gold standard for establishing causality
5. Uses routinely collected data at population level

## Exercise 1.3: Bias Identification

Identify the type of bias in each scenario:

1. In a study of coffee consumption and heart disease, participants who drink coffee are more likely to accurately recall their consumption habits.

2. A case-control study of breast cancer uses hospital controls, who may have different disease patterns than the general population.

3. In a cohort study, participants who develop the outcome are more likely to drop out of the study.

4. Researchers measuring blood pressure know which participants are in the treatment group.

## Exercise 1.4: Confounding vs. Effect Modification

For each scenario, determine if the third variable is a confounder or effect modifier:

1. Age appears to be associated with both smoking and lung cancer.

2. A drug reduces blood pressure more in younger patients than older patients.

3. Socioeconomic status is associated with both diet quality and obesity.

4. Exercise prevents heart attacks more effectively in men than women.

## Exercise 1.5: Critical Appraisal

Appraise the following hypothetical study:

**Study**: A cross-sectional survey of 500 adults in a city found that 30% of smartphone users reported sleep problems, compared to 15% of non-users.

**Questions**:
1. What are the strengths of this study design?
2. What are the main limitations?
3. What type of bias might be present?
4. How could the study be improved?

## Answers and Explanations

### Exercise 1.1 Answers:
1. **Cross-sectional study** - Measures prevalence at a single point in time
2. **Cohort study** or **RCT** - Cohort for observational, RCT for experimental
3. **Cohort study** - Follow children forward to see who develops infections
4. **RCT** - Experimental design to test vaccine efficacy
5. **Cohort study** - Long-term follow-up of exposed population

### Exercise 1.2 Answers:
1. A. Cohort study - Exposure precedes outcome
2. B. Case-control study - Starts with outcome
3. C. Cross-sectional study - No temporality
4. D. Randomized controlled trial - Randomization controls confounding
5. E. Ecological study - Population-level data

### Exercise 1.3 Answers:
1. **Recall bias** - Differential recall between groups
2. **Berkson's bias** - Hospital controls not representative
3. **Loss to follow-up bias** - Differential attrition
4. **Observer bias** - Knowledge of group affects measurement

### Exercise 1.4 Answers:
1. **Confounder** - Age affects both exposure and outcome
2. **Effect modifier** - Age changes the effect of the drug
3. **Confounder** - SES affects both diet and obesity
4. **Effect modifier** - Sex modifies the effect of exercise

### Exercise 1.5 Answers:
1. **Strengths**: Quick, inexpensive, can study multiple exposures
2. **Limitations**: Cannot establish temporality, potential reverse causation
3. **Selection bias** (non-response), **information bias** (self-report)
4. **Improvements**: Use objective measures, longitudinal design, better sampling
