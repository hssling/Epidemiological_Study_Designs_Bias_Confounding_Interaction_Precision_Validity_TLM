# Lecture Notes: Module 1 - Introduction to Epidemiological Study Designs

## Lecture Objectives
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
- Define epidemiology and its core principles
- Differentiate between descriptive and analytical epidemiology
- Identify major categories of epidemiological study designs
- Understand the importance of study design selection
- Apply Bradford Hill criteria for causality

## Lecture Structure (90 minutes)

### Part 1: What is Epidemiology? (20 minutes)
- **Definition and scope**
  - "The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems" (Last, 2001)
  - Distribution: Who, when, where
  - Determinants: Causes and risk factors
  - Application: Prevention and control

- **Core principles**
  - Population-based approach
  - Quantitative methods
  - Prevention focus
  - Evidence-based practice

- **Historical development**
  - John Snow and cholera (1854)
  - Framingham Heart Study (1948)
  - Modern epidemiology: molecular, genetic, social

### Part 2: Levels of Epidemiological Study (25 minutes)
- **Descriptive epidemiology**
  - Person: age, sex, occupation, ethnicity
  - Place: geographic distribution, urban/rural
  - Time: secular trends, seasonal patterns, epidemics
  - Purpose: hypothesis generation, health planning

- **Analytical epidemiology**
  - Tests specific hypotheses
  - Examines associations between exposures and outcomes
  - Establishes causality (when possible)

**Interactive Activity**: Show maps of disease distribution and ask students to identify patterns

### Part 3: Study Design Classification (25 minutes)
- **Timing dimension**
  - Prospective: forward in time
  - Retrospective: backward in time
  - Cross-sectional: single point in time

- **Inquiry direction**
  - Forward: exposure → outcome
  - Backward: outcome ← exposure

- **Manipulation of exposure**
  - Observational: natural exposures
  - Experimental: researcher controls exposure

**Key Question**: "What is the most appropriate design for studying the effects of air pollution on respiratory health?"

### Part 4: Establishing Causality (15 minutes)
- **Bradford Hill Criteria (1965)**
  1. Strength of association
  2. Consistency
  3. Specificity
  4. Temporality
  5. Biological gradient
  6. Plausibility
  7. Coherence
  8. Experiment
  9. Analogy

- **Modern interpretations**
  - Not all criteria need to be met
  - Strength and consistency are most important
  - Temporality is essential

**Case Study**: Smoking and lung cancer - apply Hill criteria

### Part 5: Study Design Selection (10 minutes)
- **Factors to consider**
  - Research question type
  - Frequency of exposure/outcome
  - Available resources
  - Ethical constraints
  - Feasibility

- **Decision framework**
  - Rare outcome: case-control or cohort
  - Rare exposure: cohort study
  - Experimental question: RCT when possible

## Teaching Tips
- **Use analogies**: Compare study designs to different cameras (RCT = high-resolution camera, ecological = satellite view)
- **Interactive elements**: Group discussions on research questions
- **Visual aids**: Flowcharts showing study design selection
- **Real examples**: Show excerpts from famous studies

## Common Student Questions
1. "What's the difference between incidence and prevalence?"
2. "Why can't observational studies prove causality?"
3. "When should I use a case-control vs. cohort study?"
4. "What makes RCTs the 'gold standard'?"

## Assessment Questions
1. Define epidemiology in your own words
2. Explain the difference between descriptive and analytical epidemiology
3. List three major categories of epidemiological study designs
4. What are the Bradford Hill criteria for causality?
5. For a rare outcome like brain cancer, which study design would you choose and why?
